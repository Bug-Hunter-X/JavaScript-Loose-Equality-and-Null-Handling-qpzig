# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) and null value handling.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, making debugging challenging.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a function that demonstrates this issue.  The function attempts to perform an operation on two input values (a, b). However, it fails to properly handle null values resulting in incorrect results or errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected function.  It uses strict equality (===) to reliably check for null values and avoid type coercion issues.  This is the most reliable approach for handling null and undefined values in JavaScript.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.js` with different inputs, including null values.
3. Observe the incorrect output or errors.
4. Compare with the corrected solution in `bugSolution.js`.
